Prompt the user to enter the Annual Interest Rate
cast the annual interest rate to a floating number

Prompt the user to enter the Duration in Years
cast the duration in years to a floating number 

write out the formulas
firstly we will turn the percentage values to decimal value

to get the monthly interest rate, first the annual interest rate will be divided by 100 and then divided by 12(that is, the number of months in a year) 

to calculate the number of months, the number of years will be multiplied by the number of months in a year(12)

we then write the formula for finding the monthly mortgage payment

i will be writing the formula in two places for readability purpose

first formula is monthly interest rate multiply by (1 + monthly interest rate) raise to the power of number of months

second formula is (1 + monthly interest rate) raise to the power of number of months - 1

assign the first and second formula to the mortgage monthly payment and multiply it by the principal amount

print the result..
